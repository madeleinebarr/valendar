                <p>Vanessa: And I’m Vanessa Zoltan
                    Casper: And this is Harry Potter and the Sacred Text.
                    Vanessa: Casper, one of the first conversations that we had about Harry Potter, I was
                    complaining about this inconsistency in the novels that’s always annoyed me- when
                    wizards wear muggle clothes and they don’t – And you said to me, ‘Well what if we
                    treated that as if it wasn’t an inconsistency, but it was there on purpose?’
                    That conversation was so exciting to me because it took something shallow, like this
                    shallow cynical thing that I’m really good at – I’m really good at being cynical and
                    critical and ironic – and you were asking me to be sincere and optimistic about the
                    material again. And I think that is what we’re going to do in this podcast. We are going to ask ourselves ‘what if we take this seriously? What gifts is it going to give us if
                    we love something and we love it with rigor, and we love it with commitment?’
                    Casper: hmmm…
                    Vanessa: So, why are you excited to do a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text podcast?
                    Casper: Treating Harry Potter as a sacred text was not something I was planning on
                    doing. I was in divinity school against all expectations; I was growing up in a non-religious household and never thought I would be sitting in a Bible study class learning
                    how to understand this ancient text. And it was interesting, but it never felt like it
                    was mine. I didn’t love it.
                    And I happened to go on vacation with my family and you know, after about just two
                    or three weeks with my family, I wanted to escape, and so looked for something to
                    read, something that would be comforting, something that would remind me of a
                    place where I felt safe. So I downloaded Harry Potter! And I started reading it, and
                    not only did it make me feel comfortable and safe, and took me out of the situation I
                    was in and into an imaginary world which I loved already, but the themes and the
                    questions that were in these books were so… big! They were just as big as the Bible
                    questions I’d just been reading, you know.</p>
